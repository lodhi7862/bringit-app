BringIt
A private, family-only mobile app that allows parents to send grocery or errand orders to their children or trusted family members. Parents create orders using saved items or photos. Items are permanently stored for reuse. Orders can only be sent within an isolated family network. The receiver completes items step-by-step and confirms completion.
Problem Statement
Families frequently delegate grocery and errand tasks to children or relatives. Today, this happens through unstructured messages (e.g., WhatsApp), which leads to:
•
Confusion about what to buy
•
Too many clarification calls
•
Forgotten items
•
No visibility into progress
Existing shopping apps are built for individuals or deliveries — not for family delegation.
Target Users
Primary
•
Parents (30–60)
•
Children / young adults (15–30)
Context of Use
•
Grocery shopping
•
Pharmacy runs
•
Household items
•
Local store errands
Core Principles
1.
Private by default – families only
2.
Visual first – photos over text
3.
Low effort for parents
4.
Simple, human language (not strict units)
5.
Reusable – items don’t disappear
App Structure (High Level)
Two Main Concepts
1.
Saved Items – permanent catalog
2.
Orders – temporary, sent to a person
These must be clearly separated in logic and UI.
Identity & Networks
User Creation (v1)
•
User enters:
o
Name
o
Optional profile photo
•
App generates:
o
Unique user ID
o
QR code
No passwords or emails required in v1.
Family Network (Isolated Connections)
•
Each user belongs to one private network (family)
•
Users connect by:
o
Scanning QR code
o
Entering user code
•
Connection must be accepted
Rules
•
Only connected users can see each other
•
Orders can only be sent within the same network
•
No global search, no public users
Saved Items (Permanent)
What Is a Saved Item?
A reusable item that lives in the user’s personal catalog.
Fields
•
Photo (recommended)
•
Item name (optional)
•

Behavior
•
When an item is added to an order, it is saved automatically
•
Items remain available until explicitly deleted
•
Removing an item from an order does not delete it from saved items

Final Product Opinion
This is not a grocery app. This is a family coordination tool.
If you keep that mental model, your decisions will stay correct.
