Prompt for Replit

Build a mobile application called BringIt — a fully local, family-only coordination app for grocery and errand delegation between parents and children.

Core Rule (Very Important)

ALL DATA MUST BE LOCAL.

No cloud services

No backend servers

No Firebase

No cloud storage

No authentication providers

Everything runs offline-first and is stored on-device.

Core Idea

BringIt is not a grocery delivery app.
It is a private family coordination tool that replaces unclear WhatsApp messages with a simple, visual workflow.

Target Users

Parents (30–60): create and send orders

Children / young adults (15–30): receive and complete orders

Core Principles

Private by default — family only

Visual first — photos over text

Low effort for parents

Simple, human language (no strict units)

Reusable items — nothing disappears unless deleted

Offline-first — works without internet

App Structure (Strict Separation)

The app must clearly separate:

Saved Items (permanent catalog)

Orders (temporary tasks)

These are separate data models and UI sections.

Identity & Family Network (Local Only)
User Creation (v1)

User enters:

Name

Optional profile photo

App generates:

Unique local user ID

Local QR code (encodes user ID)

No passwords, emails, or accounts.

Family Network

Family members connect by:

Scanning QR code

OR entering user code manually

Connection requires acceptance

Connections exist only on the device

Rules

Only connected users are visible

Orders can only be sent to connected users

No global users

No internet dependency

Image Handling (Critical Requirement)
Image Pipeline

When a photo is taken or selected:

Resize image to a small fixed resolution (e.g. 64×64 or 128×128)

Extract RGB pixel values

Convert image into an SVG representation

Store SVG data or RGB arrays as local variables

Delete the original bitmap image

No image files are stored.
No cloud storage is used.

SVGs are used for:

Saved items

Order items

Thumbnails and previews

Saved Items (Permanent, Local)

A Saved Item is a reusable item stored locally on the device.

Fields

SVG image data (generated from photo)

Optional item name

Optional last-used note

Behavior

Adding an item to an order automatically saves it

Items persist locally until explicitly deleted

Removing an item from an order does not remove it from saved items

Orders
Order Structure

Local Order ID

Sender (local user)

Receiver (connected family member)

List of items

Status:

Pending

In Progress

Completed

Local timestamp

Parent (Sender) Flow

Tap New Order

Add items via:

Saved items

Camera (new photo → converted to SVG)

For each item:

Quantity (number)

Optional note (free text like “1 kg”, “large pack”, “any brand”)

Review order

Select connected family member

Send order locally

UI must always show:
“Sending to: [Name]”

Receiver (Completer) Flow
Receiving an Order

Local notification: “New order from Ammi”

Order screen shows:

Sender name

List of items with SVG previews, quantity, and notes

Completing Items

For each item:

Mark as Found / Done

Optional:

Add clarification note

Replace item SVG if needed (new photo → SVG)

Order status updates immediately on the device.

Completing Order

Tap Order Complete

Sender receives local confirmation

Order moves to history

Order Status Logic

Pending → no items completed

In Progress → at least one item completed

Completed → receiver confirms completion

Notifications (Local)

New order received

Order completed

No push notifications (offline only)

Local Storage

Use local storage only:

SQLite / Room / Hive / AsyncStorage (platform choice allowed)

Store:

Users

Family connections

Saved items (SVG / RGB arrays)

Orders and order items

Keep schemas simple and readable.

Success Criteria (v1)

Works fully offline

No cloud dependencies

Clear visual orders

Reduced clarification between family members

Reusable item catalog works reliably

Explicit Non-Goals (v1)

Cloud sync

Accounts or login

Payments

Store integrations

Delivery tracking

Public users

Ratings or reviews

Final Guiding Principle

This is not a grocery app.
This is a local-first family coordination tool.

Every design and technical decision must respect:

Privacy

Simplicity

Offline usage

Visual clarity
