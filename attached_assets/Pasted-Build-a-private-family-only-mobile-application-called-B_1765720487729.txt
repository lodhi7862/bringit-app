Build a private, family-only mobile application called “BringIt” that helps families coordinate grocery and errand tasks without using public chat apps.

This is not a shopping or delivery app.
It is a family coordination tool for sending and completing errands.

Core Concept

The app has two clearly separated systems:

Saved Items – permanent, reusable catalog

Orders – temporary task lists sent between family members

Saved Items must persist forever unless deleted.
Orders are created, completed, and archived.

Users & Identity (v1)

No email, password, or phone number authentication

User creation requires:

Name

Optional profile photo

App generates:

Unique user ID

Shareable QR code

Family Network (Private by Default)

Each user belongs to one private family network

Users connect by:

Scanning a QR code

Entering a user code

Connections must be accepted

Rules

Users can only see connected family members

Orders can only be sent within the same network

No public users

No global search

Saved Items (Permanent Catalog)
Definition

A Saved Item is a reusable item stored in the user’s personal catalog.

Fields

Photo (recommended)

Item name (optional)

Last used note (optional)

Behavior

When an item is added to an order, it is automatically saved

Removing an item from an order does NOT delete it

Items remain until explicitly deleted

Send order

UI must always show:
“Sending to: [Receiver Name]”

No strict units. Use human-friendly language.

Receiver (Completer) Flow
Receiving Orders

Push notification:
“New order from [Sender Name]”

Order screen shows:

Sender name

Item list with photos and notes

Completing Items

For each item:

Mark as Done / Found

Optional:

Add clarification note

Order status updates in real time.

Completing Order

Receiver taps Order Complete

Sender receives confirmation

Order moves to history

Order Status Logic

Pending → no items completed

In Progress → at least one item completed

Completed → receiver confirms completion

Notifications (v1)

New order received

Order completed

Technical Requirements

Schemas should be simple and readable.
